## Application of k-NN and Time-Series Forecasting in Telecom Industry
### Introduction and overview

• Using k-NN to predict customer churn in telecom industry

Goal: To know more about what make the customer churn and predicting if he/she will churn or not.
Data set: The data was downloaded from IBM Sample Data Sets for customer retention programs. You can download it from here: https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer- churn/download

• Using Time Series Forecasting to predict the power consumption in telecommunication networks

Goal: Applied time series forecasting method 

I selected the power consumption in telecommunication networks, which operates primarily in Pittsburgh. You can find the data source here: https://www.kaggle.com/apoorvabhide/energy- consumption-time-series-forecasting-in-r/#data

The data set includes information about:
- Datatime - Show power consumption in each timestamp and date.
- Power consumption in telecommunication networks - the volume that the power was used
